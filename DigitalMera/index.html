                    <p> This interactive map brings H.P. Mera's 1940 study, <i>Population Changes in the Rio Grande
                            Glaze-paint Area</i>, into the digital age.</p>
                    <p>Using ceramic typologies to track settlement shifts over time, Mera mapped 205 archaeological
                        sites across eight cultural regions in the Middle Rio Grande Valley.</p>
                    <p>Our project lets you explore these patterns across five time periods and view some site details
                        --all while preserving the integrity of sensitive site locations.</p>

                    <p>The objective of the present study is to gain a general idea of the movements
                        and shifts in a population, in some ways diverse in composition, but which, on the other
                        hand, possessed in common certain cultural features that may be used as indices. It is
                        on one of these features, a series of ceramic developments, that considerable reliance
                        will be placed to indicate time intervals and spatial distribution.</p>
                    <p>The area in which the events to be discussed took place was centered largely
                        in the valley of the Rio Grande in central New Mexico, with extensions principally to
                        the east. Boundary lines for the whole, as well as those used in delimiting its several sub-areas, are shown on map 1. This region is sometimes referred to as Rio Grande
                        Glaze-paint territory.</p>
                    <p>A period extending from about the middle of the 14th century to the beginning
                        of the 18th covers the time interval involved.</p>
                    <p>Source material was obtained from the results of an archaeological survey conducted by the Laboratory of Anthropology. Nearly ten years were spent in the undertaking, during which time many hundreds of ruins were visited and studied, before it was
                        felt that enough information had been gained upon which to base even the outline here
                        presented.</p>
                    <p>The several chronological implications that appear herein are based on dates
                        s~cured from such dendrochronological studies as were applicable, or, for later years,
                        on authoritative historical data.</p>
                    <p>Due to the difficulty of treating the area as a whole because of its size, it
                        has been deemed expedient to create a number of arbitrary sub-divisions. To these
                        names have been applied which are derived from the linguistic groups known to have inhabited corresponding sections of country in the 17th century. It must be emphasized,
                        however, that there is no intent to imply that these groups might have occupied the
                        same territories prior to that date, although such a possibility may exist . The names
                        are used largely as a matter of convenience.</p>
                    <p>In so large a tract there is naturally a great diversity in topography. As
                        this subject may have some value in picturing environmental factors under which there
                        existed a closely similar economic system, attention will be very briefly _directed to
                        the topographical and ecological features of each division.</p>
                    <p>Because pottery types, by reason of their presence or absence at any given
                        site, will be used to trace changes in centers of population, it is necessary that the
                        reader be acquainted with their position in a previously proven and generally accepted
                        sequence.</p>
                    <p>Previous to the first half of the 14th century only black-on-white wares were
                        being produced in the region covered by this paper. Later a red ware, an adaptation of
                        a western style originating in the Little Colorado cultural area, with decorations in
                        a glaze paint, became dominant. Following this, polychromes appeared that continued
                        the use of glaze paint up to the beginning of the 18th century after which time this
                        kind of pigment appears to have been discontinued.</p>
                    <p>As the matter of adoption of western red-ware styles (Heshotauthla Polychrome)<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
                        and their replacement of local black-on-white fashions has previously been discussed elsewhere it will not be repeated here.
                        After this period and following the establishment of a local red-ware glazepaint type, there ensued a continuous series of bowl rim developments that may serve to
                        broadly distinguish time horizons. These developmental steps were first brought to attention by the Kidders in 1917,3 Still later, the same subject has received further
                        notice, 4 with the result that the series is now familiar enough to students of Southwestern archaeology to require no additional explanation.
