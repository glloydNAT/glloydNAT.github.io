                <p>The objective of the present study is to gain a general idea of the movements
                    and shifts in a population, in some ways diverse in composition, but which, on the other
                    hand, possessed in common certain cultural features that may be used as indices. It is
                    on one of these features, a series of ceramic developments, that considerable reliance
                    will be placed to indicate time intervals and spatial distribution.</p>
                <p>The area in which the events to be discussed took place was centered largely
                    in the valley of the Rio Grande in central New Mexico, with extensions principally to
                    the east. Boundary lines for the whole, as well as those used in delimiting its several sub-areas, are shown on map 1. This region is sometimes referred to as Rio Grande
                    Glaze-paint territory.</p>
                <p>A period extending from about the middle of the 14th century to the beginning
                    of the 18th covers the time interval involved.</p>
                <p>Source material was obtained from the results of an archaeological survey conducted by the Laboratory of Anthropology. Nearly ten years were spent in the undertaking, during which time many hundreds of ruins were visited and studied, before it was
                    felt that enough information had been gained upon which to base even the outline here
                    presented.</p>
                <p>The several chronological implications that appear herein are based on dates
                    s~cured from such dendrochronological studies as were applicable, or, for later years,
                    on authoritative historical data.</p>
                <p>Due to the difficulty of treating the area as a whole because of its size, it
                    has been deemed expedient to create a number of arbitrary sub-divisions. To these
                    names have been applied which are derived from the linguistic groups known to have inhabited corresponding sections of country in the 17th century. It must be emphasized,
                    however, that there is no intent to imply that these groups might have occupied the
                    same territories prior to that date, although such a possibility may exist . The names
                    are used largely as a matter of convenience.</p>
                <p>In so large a tract there is naturally a great diversity in topography. As
                    this subject may have some value in picturing environmental factors under which there
                    existed a closely similar economic system, attention will be very briefly _directed to
                    the topographical and ecological features of each division.</p>
                <p>Because pottery types, by reason of their presence or absence at any given
                    site, will be used to trace changes in centers of population, it is necessary that the
                    reader be acquainted with their position in a previously proven and generally accepted
                    sequence.</p>
                <p>Previous to the first half of the 14th century only black-on-white wares were
                    being produced in the region covered by this paper. Later a red ware, an adaptation of
                    a western style originating in the Little Colorado cultural area, with decorations in
                    a glaze paint, became dominant. Following this, polychromes appeared that continued
                    the use of glaze paint up to the beginning of the 18th century after which time this
                    kind of pigment appears to have been discontinued.</p>
                <p>As the matter of adoption of western red-ware styles (Heshotauthla Polychrome)<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>
                    and their replacement of local black-on-white fashions has previously been discussed elsewhere it will not be repeated here.
                    After this period and following the establishment of a local red-ware glazepaint type, there ensued a continuous series of bowl rim developments that may serve to
                    broadly distinguish time horizons. These developmental steps were first brought to attention by the Kidders in 1917,3 Still later, the same subject has received further
                    notice, 4 with the result that the series is now familiar enough to students of Southwestern archaeology to require no additional explanation.</p>oject advisor: <a href="https://www.lipingyang.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Liping Yang</a></h6>

<!--

It will no doubt be remembered that in one system (Mera) these rim forms have
been divided into groups lettered from A to F, each group including one or more types
or sub-types. For the present purpose only the main groups will be considered as representing time horizons.
The translation of stratigraphic position into terms of the calendar is largely
based on the work of W. S. Stallings, Jr.5 who, by means of his studies in dendrochronology, has succeeded in securing dates that furnish an idea, within some fraction of a
centur y, of the years in which these ceramic groups flourished. Such datings are close
enough for the present purpose, because in so large an area there must have been a considerable difference in time involved in the development of any given style-group, due
to an advance in one locality and a lag in another.
The following dates have been selected from Mr. Stallings' published work to
approximate the time just before and during the introduction of glaze-paint red-wares
into villages in which black-on-white pottery styles were the standard usage .
Site No. Date Heshotauthla Polychrome Group A

Using the latest dates given for each of the above sites, it seems evident that
Group A styles had not become popular up to 1337. This at least appears to hold true
for the northern part of the area, from which these dates were drawn. There is, nevertheless, some slight evidence that farther south these styles may have come into favor
somewhat earlier.
It will also be seen that Heshotauthla Polychrome, the western type from which
early Group A forms were derived, had already put i n an appearance ln some of these
sites.
Turning now to several dated ruins which show from the percentages of glazepaint sherds that the new fashion had begun to gain a firm foothold or was a lready established, the following list is presented.

L .A. 251 1370-1392 Full-y established Present
Comparing this list with the one first given, it can be seen that glaze-paint
red-wares related to the Group A development, arter making an appearance in black-onwhite sites or the first quarter or the 14th century, show increasing percentages until
they are round practically replacing black-on-white wares around the middle or that
century. The last two sites in the latter list also indicate that by 1392 Cieneguilla
Glaze-on-yellow, the final type to develop 'Within Group A, had already arrived prior to
the abandonment or those villages.
It would seem to be within reason therefore, ror the present purpose, to assign
all villages showing appreciable amounts or Group A pottery types to a period which
could be said to have begun about the middle part or the 14th century.
As no great changes, rrom an historical angle, seem to have taken place during
the existence or Group B pottery styles and as it appears to have been a quite localized development, only a single date will be cited.
Site No. Date Group B
L.A. 183 1413-1450 + X Fully established
These dates were derived rrom the charred timbers or two rooms, on the floors
or which were round only crushed vessels or Group B pottery. Farther south, where this
rorm occurs only sporadically, Group A is believed to have merged directly into C with
no intermediate rorms.
For an approximation or the period when Group Crim styles were in vogue two
dates are orrered in evidence.

It would appear rrom these dates that it is sare to assign the extended use or
Group C rorms to a time well arter the middle or the 15th century as Group B pottery
was still in existence in some places as late as 1450. (See site L.A. 183 under Group
B.)
The situation is somewhat less fortunate ror determining a time level ror Group
D types· as only one date is available which can be applied to this group alone.

This date was secured from a series of adjacent rooms in which the latest type
of pottery occurring belonged in Group D. As Group C appears to have been continued in
use toward the latter part of the 15th century the above date would seem to indicate
that the transition from c to D took place in the later years of that same century. But
to estimate how long the latter remained in favor it will be necessary first to arrive
at an approximate date for the appearance of the following development in style, the
several rim forms of which have been classified as a group under the letter E. While
doing this, it will also facilitate matters if the time- span of Group Ebe determined
before finally returning to a discussion of the duration of Group D styles.
Here again but a single date i~ available but fortunately, in addition, there
are certain historical data from which logical deductions can be made.
Site No. Date Group E
L.A. 170 Fully developed
The above date was secured from an excavated room in a ruin lying just outside
the boundary of the glaze-paint area proper. In this room typical E pottery was found
on the floor.
For the following historical references the writer is indebted to N. C. Nelson1s6
excellent paper in which he has summarized the evidence gleaned from early documents as
to the identity of ruins in the Galisteo Basin. Without going into any exact detail,
it is learned that the Spanish in 1541 discovered both inhabited and deserted villages
in this section and furthermore received information that those then in ruins had been
destroyed sixteen years prior to that date, or in 1525.
During the Laboratory survey of this particular area it was found that there
were eight sites which showed the presence of large percentages of E but that only
three of these demonstrated the later and terminal F series. These three are well •documented as having survived to a time as late as 1680. Therefore the remaining five must
necessarily include both the inhabited and abandoned villages noted by the Spanish in
1541 . Assuming then that these five settlements must include those spoken of as· destroyed and abandoned in 1525, it is evident that E was a fully established fashion.by
the first quarter of the 16th century.
Having arrived at an early date for this style group, attention will be directed to another somewhat later which will be of assistance in determining the duration of
Group E pottery. F . W Hodge7 cites Espejo as mentioning the existence of five Sia
(Tsia), villages in 1582. It is a matter of record that by the year 1680 these had
been reduced to single community which still bears that name.
Four glaze-paint ruins in that area have been examined, the farthest of which
is not more than six miles from the present inhabited pueblo . It is presumed that some
of these sites represent those noted by Espejo. None of the four show any pottery
later than E. The date 1582 for the latest pottery found in these sites thus agrees
perfectly with the dendrochronologi cal date previously submitted for Group E.
Turni ng back to the question of how long Group D styles persisted, it can be
argued that if E was evolved from Din the early years of the 16th century and typical
Group C styles a r e known to have been in existence as late as 1462 then the D group of
forms must be considered as having been in u s e not longer than during the last quarter
of the 15th century and perhaps through the first decade of the 16th.

POPULATION CHANGES IN THE RIO GRANDE GLAZE-PAINT AREA
Following Group E styles, further changes in rim forms as well as a _very obvious degeneration in technique mark the final appearance of glaze-paint wares (Group F)
in the Rio Grande. Historically documented sites inhabited at the time of the Pueblo
rebellion in 1680 and the reconquest of 1692 plainly demonstrate that Group F styles
were in the way of being consistently replaced by a northern matte-paint ware, Tewa
Polychrome. 8 A few years prior to the rebellion, in a number of villages which had
been deserted by reason of Apache raids (variously from 1674 to 1676), it can be seen
that Group F fashions were at their height.

As regards the time when degeneration of glaze-paint pottery began, which finally resulted in the types that are included in Group F, no direct information has yet
been made available . Nevertheless, a reason may be advanced for such a lowering of
standards in pottery manufacture and tentative deductions may be attempted. By way of
explanation, it can be said that progressively greater degrees of exploitation and oppression exerted by the Spanish colonists, as they gained dominance over the native inhabitants, might have had a great deal to do vith the matter. Furthermore conditions
of this character are known to have prevailed throughout most of the 17th century. On
a premise that harassment and persecution would affect the quality of a handicraft, a
transition from E to F may be postulated for some time about the middle of that century.
The writer is inclined to this viev because in sites known to have been occupied only
during the period of the rebellion a number of rim forms may usually be found in which
certain Group E characteristics have persisted, shoving that a full standardization of
F forms had never entirely been effected.
All indications point to a complete discontinuance of glaze-paint decoration
very shortly after the opening of the 18th century.
Using the estimated datings for the six groups from A to Fas presented above,
the time covered in the development of the entire glaze-paint sequence can, for the
needs of this study, be divided into four periods as follows:
Period 1. This begins with the acceptance of Group A styles as a regional
ceramic cultural factor. It would also include Group B which appears to have been
merely a localized development in a rather restricted section located in the northeastern part of the glaze-paint area. This period would roughly correspond to the interval between the years 1350 and 1450.
Period 2. Group C styles are included here. Apparently comparatively shortlived, these seem to have run their allotted courses from about 1450 to 1490.
Period 3. What may be considered a transitional phase between tvo well-marked
groups of pottery styles appears to be represented during the twenty-five years included in this period. There is a great variability in the rim forms classed under Group
D. The time interval between 1490 and 1515 has been arbitrarily chosen to approximately cover this stage of development.
Period 4. This period is allotted to Group E styles. These appear to have persisted over a proportionately greater ~ength of time than those of any other group and
are estimated to have extended from about 1515 to 1650.
Period 5. Another short period in length of time. The interval represented,
1650 to 1700, is believed to be long enough to account for the life of Group F types.
There vere two main classes of sites encountered during the survey. Those that
appear to have been permanently inhabited and a smaller number with indications of only
temporary or perhaps seasonal occupation. The former vill be indicated on the several
maps by a solid square, the latter by a solid triangular symbol.
8. Mera, 1939, pp. 11-12. 
6 POPULATION CHANGES IN THE RIO GRANDE GLAZE-PAINT AREA
As previously explained the whole area involved in the development of Rio Grandeglaze-paint wares has been divided for convenience into sub-areas bea ring names taken
from linguistic groups. Beginning with the southernmo st, these are numbered as f ollows:
1 and 1 A Piro
2 Tompiro
3 Jumano
4 and 4 A West Tiwa
5 East Tiwa
6 and 6 A Tano-Towa
7 Keres
8 North Tiwa
Maps representing one or more tempor~l periods have been prepared for e very
spatial division. These maps bear both the division name and period numb er and a re
placed immediately following the several lists of sites.
By ascertaining the presence or absence of a given site on the temporal maps of
any territorial division, its length of occupancy and the period during which it was
abandoned can be noted. The latest pottery type found at any ruin is employe d as t h e
determining factor. Thus it will be possible to visualize changes in the status of
population over approximately three hundred and fifty years.
THE PIRO DIVISION (1 and lA, map 1)
This area is separable into three parts on topographical grounds. Of the three , the archaeology of the section included in the valley of the Rio Grande is b est known.
Here with few exceptions villages occupied positions on river terraces above bot t om
lands. All of the valley in this division lies in the Lower Sonoran zone.
Since Bandelier's time many of the larger sites bordering this stream have b een
the subject of discussion by historians who have sought to identify them with s ome of
those named in early Spanish documents. It may be that the present study, by indicating time horizons through the medium of pottery types, will become of value in pointing
out those villages which might have been occupied at a time coincident with the arrival
of Europeans.
On the east, the valley is bounded for nearly its entire length by a range of
hills which separate it from a land-locked basin, the northern end of the J ornada del
Muerto. This basin is limited on the north by the high, well-wooded Chupadero Mesa.
A less elevated north-south extension of that same mesa, clothed in juniper and pinon,
closes it in on the east. To the south a great expanse of low sand dunes separates
this upper part of the Jornada del Muerto from the lower portion which extends for over
a hundred miles in that direction.
Upon examining the floor of the basin it is at once obvious that at a time not
far remote it was occupied by a large number of shallow ponds and lakes now completely
dry. There appear to have been two sources of water in former times sufficient to have
kept these lakes alive . These are two drainages that originate in the higher parts of
the Chupadero Mesa to the north and then follow a southerly course into the upper part
of the basin where their channels eventually become l ost in a flat expanse. At present.permanent water is found only in pools, even in the upper reaches of these streams, and.deep erosion resulting from floods has so deepened them that their beds now lie far below the level of the ol d lake bottoms. This lowering of the water- table probably has
had a great deal to do with the present condition of aridity.
